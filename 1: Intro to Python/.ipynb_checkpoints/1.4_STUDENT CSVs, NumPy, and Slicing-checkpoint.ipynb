It contains a **TON** of complex and sophisticated mathematical functions, but for our purposes it allows us to easily create and manipulate multidimensional lists. For instance, it can take a CSV file and copy all of its contents in a multidimensional list for you.  All in 1 line of code. Ah... python. \n",
    "\n",
    "*(Skip this paragraph if you don't care)* The other cool thing about NumPy is that it actually uses C++ code instead of Python sometimes! Python is a language built off of C++, so to make things (much, much) faster NumPy actually dips below high-level Python and gets into the nitty-gritty of C++ to make it a ton speedier. More on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "And like we just mentioned about importing libraries and nicknames, nearly everyone that imports numpy gives it the nickname of np.  Just go with it, I guess it's cause you don't want to have to write out numpy every time you use one of its functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "> 1) it makes things a lot easier to keep the CSV file you're working with in the same directory (folder) as your python code<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2) the delimiter is a comma (',') because this is a CSV file (remember:  COMMA separated values)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> 3) the ```skiprows``` is an optional parameter, but any time you have a header row you set this value equal to 1<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> 4) ```dtype``` means data type.  You can force numpy to try and interpret your data as a particular data type (e.g., float, int, string, etc.), but setting it equal to ```None``` lets numpy try to figure out what type of data it is.  Most of the time, this is the best approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this ```loadtxt()``` function runs, the data variable will be a multidimensional list with all of the data from the file.  Nice. This is a numpy list, which will be explained later but isn't super incredibly important, except that you might hear me refer to a numpy list as a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how we did ```import numpy as np```. We have to do this before running any code. Just like defining variables in Jupyter Notebook, though, it doesn't have to happen in a cell that precedes another:\n",

    "```\n",
    "data.shape\t\t# will return the size of the list (rows, columns)\n",

Pretty much all of the popular python libraries have some really informative documentation, and the contributors to these projects spend a lot of time and effort adding the information in their documentation to their docstrings. When you are inside the parentheses of a function in Jupyter Notebook, just press ```shift-tab``` to see the docstring preview, or ```shift-tab``` twice to see it expanded. Try it here:"

Generally you just need to explain the necessary inputs of a function, what it does, and it should output.\n",

This doesn't mean it's an $n$-dimensional list, it just means it has $n$ elements in 1-dimension. This is because vectors are traditionally used to point to a location in an $n$-dimensional space, so it needs $n$ elements to specify a unique location. Like how you have x- and y- coordinates to describe a location in 2-dimensions, or x-, y-, and z- coordinates for 3-dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Matrices* (singular is *matrix*) are 2-dimensional lists. A matrix might typically be described as an $M$ by $N$ matrix, which means it has $M$ rows and $N$ columns. You can also think of a matrix as a list of vectors. You'll probably also see someone describe a matrix with more than 2 dimensions, which is technically a tensor but doesn't really matter that much. So maybe it's an $M$ by $N$ by $P$ 'matrix,' which is 3-dimensional.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Tensors* are just matrices that are more than 2-dimensions. I'm pretty sure this definition is just mathematical, because for all intents and purposes you'll call any numpy list a matrix (or a vector if it's 1-dimension, but not necessarily). When you get into machine learning, you'll notice that there are libraries that use special matrices that are like numpy matrices, but they call them tensors to differentiate between a special, machine-learning matrix and a numpy matrix.\n",

    "There's one more thing we'll talk about before giving you some practice, but I'll go into a lot more depth with it later.
